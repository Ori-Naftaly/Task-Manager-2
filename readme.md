## Task-Manager App 2

A simple Task Manager App that saves your tasks to the browser's local storage.

## Reflection

I implemented more JavaScript to this project by giving the user the option to filter out tasks by finished and unfinished. The app saves to local storage uppon creating or deleting a task. If we remove the task then it removes it from local storage as well.
